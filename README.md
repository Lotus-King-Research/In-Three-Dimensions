## :grey_question: Scope of Work

The initial scope of work aims at understanding the process where 1) a physical object is translated into a data object, 2) the data object is edited and refined, and 3) scenes are created by arranging data objects together and by adding motion to the arrangements. 

In the process under investigation, the input is a physical object, and the output is a data object. The output data object accurately represents the original physical object. The data object must then be readily usable in popular VR and AR development platforms and common 3D-printing software. 

This project is focused on understanding how the process between the input and the output might work.

- Mapping out options for 3D scanning:
  - methods
  - precision
  - colour
  - portability
  - compatibility with downstream applications
  - cost

- Mapping out options to edit and refine objects
  - methods
  - key software platforms
  - available talent (e.g. Fiverr)
  - work supervision
  - outline of an example project workflow

- Mapping out options to create scenes with motions
  - methods
  - key software platforms
  - available talent (e.g. Fiverr)
  - work supervision
  - outline of an example project workflow
